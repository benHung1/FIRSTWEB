        <p class="mid">London's Young Vic theatre staged a fascinating experiment this week. It attempted over three nights to get GPT-3, an AI natural language system that has gobbled up vast amounts of text from the web, to write a play.

            It was not meant to do this alone. This was a collaborative exercise involving human writers Chinonyerem Odimba and Nina Segal, three actors, and director Jennifer Tang.
            
            When I went along on the second night, she was guiding her team and the audience through the process, demonstrating how GPT-3 worked by getting it to undertake tasks set by us - such as "make up a Shakespeare sonnet in the style of a reality TV star".
            
            They then set about building on a few scenes the AI had written the previous night,prompting it to build on a scenario involving characters called "Beastman" and "Beastwoman" who appeared to be in a post-apocalyptic world.</p>
